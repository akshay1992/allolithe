Nov 09 2016:
Added examples folder with the prototype "app"
For the time being it hooks into the SoundEngine, and can instantiate modules (along with their default views)
Modified run/stop functions in SoundEngine to use getSink() instead of pointer
Added soundengine to al_allolithe.hpp

TODO: 
defaultGUI maker
Widgets for inlets and outlets
Patch cables

------------
Nov 10 2016:
Created simple oscillator app as an example. Borrows from an al App example and inserts the oscillator module. works. Gui works. ++Nov 11th
added createDefaultView to Module from old project (this is untested, and may look weird) 
Removed spatialize, DSP, Process from sink -- monolithically need to define all processing in onSound now
-- Lithe modular app not added in this commit. See next commit. 
 
--------------
Nov 11th 
Added all examples from folder. -- they don't build

--------------
Nov 11th
Redone test cases for SoundEngine. 
Added Exceptions and integrated into soundengine tests. Patching tests still failing (look into this)
Changed runtime_error exception from getModuleRef to a NodeNotFoundException
Deleted empty patcher gui from allolithe 
Rearranged files in the litheModularApp. App still doesn't build. (seg fault upon loading)

---------------
Nov 16
Changed Lithe branch to master
modified API for patch and unpatch to use NodeInfo
passing tests: soundengine patch and unpatch tests

--------------
Nov 20
Added a wrapper class for lithe Atlas so that distances can be dealt with. 
Spherical atlas is written and tested. Works as expected with a linear distance mapping.
Added a parameter not instantiated exception (for ease of debugging) within al::Module

-------------
Nov 22
Added std::map for RegisteredModules and InstantiatedNodes in SoundEngine
Passes tests.

Seg faults when instantiating from GUI. Instantiates fine when done via code. (BUG)
