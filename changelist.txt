Added Module
Added Sink

Still can't decide how the processing architecture should be on the sink
However, it seems like the best way is to treat the io as another parameter, and then just use that
within the DSP function. 

This way, you don't have to rewrite the processing structure.

Then, you add onSound in SoundEngine, and then run Sink.process() within while(io()) {} 
This way you have everything.

You also need to think about using an onSound() anyways. Such that it takes care of the stop/start mechanism. 

Meanwhile. in either case, add test cases for the basic functionality before putting this into the picture. 

Cool? Cool.
